**Retail-Sales-Customer-Satisfaction-Analysis**
This research examines retail sales data with an emphasis on forecasting, sales patterns, and customer satisfaction.  Purchase quantities, product categories, return rates, and payment methods are among the sales and customer feedback data included in the collection.  The objectives are to understand sales dynamics, determine what influences consumer happiness, and project purchase volumes for upcoming years. 
While Power BI was utilized for analysis, visualisation, and forecasting.
Excel was utilized for data cleansing.

TOOL USED:-

1.	**Data Cleaning with Excel** : Excel was initially used to prepare and clean the data. The tasks listed below were completed:
• Discount_Applied was changed to a numeric value. 
• Values in Return_Status that were incorrect have been standardized to "Yes" or "No". 
• Customer_Age and Quantity data that were missing or none were handled. 
• Purchase_Date's mixed date formats were combined.

2. **Analysis and Visualizations with Power BI** : Power BI was used to import and evaluate this cleaned dataset. 
• New calculated columns have been created, include Age_Group (Youth, Adult, Senior) and Net_Sale (Purchase_Amount - Discount). 
**Visualizations**: A number of graphs and charts were made to show important metrics, including:
• Sales Data by Product Category and Store Type.
• Store_Location: Customer satisfaction.  
• Product_Category return rates. 
• Method of Payment vs Purchase Amount. 
**KPIs/key performance indicators:**
• Customer satisfaction is average. 
• The sum of net sales. 
• The percentage of return rates.

3. **Forecasting:** Using Power BI's forecasting capabilities, estimating future purchase amounts based on previous data, purchase trends and future projections were developed.

Method of Forecasting Historical data was used to anticipate future purchasing volumes. Future trends were projected using Power BI's built-in forecasting tool. Based on a time-series analysis, the projection takes into account variables including product categories, yearly purchase quantities, and return rates. The presentation, which covers the years 2023–2027, gives stands information about anticipated sales patterns and aids in their planning.

**Project Perspectives** 
• The firm may determine which shop locations and product kinds perform better by looking at the Net Sales by shop Type and Product Category, which reveal a substantial variation. 
• Products with high return rates can be found using the Return Rates by Product Category, which offers information about customer discontent. 
• The most widely used payment methods and their correlation with total purchase amounts are clearly understood thanks to the Payment Method vs. Purchase Amount graphic. 
• The examination of customer satisfaction by store location aids in identifying areas for improvement in customer service.

**Conclusion:**
 Retail sales and customer satisfaction are thoroughly covered in this investigation. In order to improve customer satisfaction, optimize product offerings, and improve sales techniques, organizations can make data-driven decisions by predicting future sales and identifying critical performance measures.
